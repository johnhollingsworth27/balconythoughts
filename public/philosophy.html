                                    Ancient Philosophy: Ancient philosophy refers to the philosophical thought that emerged from the 6th century BCE to the end of the Roman Empire. This period was marked by the birth of Western philosophy in ancient Greece, with key figures such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, who laid the foundation for ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and political philosophy. Their works, such as Plato's "Republic" and Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics," continue to influence contemporary philosophical thought. Other prominent schools of thought in this period include the Epicureans, Stoics, and Skeptics.<br><br>

Key figures such as Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, and Niccolò Machiavelli contributed to the development of political philosophy, metaphysics, and the philosophy of the human mind. Important works from this period include Machiavelli's "The Prince" and Pico's "Oration on the Dignity of Man."
